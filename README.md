# Cryptarithm Solver with Genetic Algorithms

This application uses two genetic algorithms, cyclic crossover and PMX crossover, to solve cryptarithm problems, such as the classic example SEND + MORE = MONEY. The application is designed to be flexible and can handle any combination of similar cryptarithms. It also includes two parent selection algorithms: roulette and tournament of size 3, providing a robust and adaptable approach to finding solutions.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithms**: Implemented cyclic crossover and PMX crossover.
- **Parent Selection**: Supports roulette selection and tournament selection with a size of 3.
- **Flexible Input**: Capable of solving any valid cryptarithm problem.

## Installation
